/*
=== Item Click Call Sequences ===
These are the default click code call sequences used when clicking on stuff with an item.

Atoms:

mob/ClickOn() calls the item's resolve_attackby() proc.
item/resolve_attackby() calls the target atom's attackby() proc.

Mobs:

mob/living/attackby() after checking for surgery, calls the item's attack() proc.
item/attack() generates attack logs, sets click cooldown and calls the mob's attacked_with_item() proc. If you override this, consider whether you need to set a click cooldown, play attack animations, and generate logs yourself.
mob/attacked_with_item() should then do mob-type specific stuff (like determining hit/miss, handling shields, etc) and then possibly call the item's apply_hit_effect() proc to actually apply the effects of being hit.

Item Hit Effects:

item/apply_hit_effect() can be overriden to do whatever you want. However "standard" physical damage based weapons should make use of the target mob's hit_with_weapon() proc to
avoid code duplication. This includes items that may sometimes act as a standard weapon in addition to having other effects (e.g. stunbatons on harm intent).
